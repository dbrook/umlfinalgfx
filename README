 Introduction
--------------
After some trying times attempting to merge what we wanted to do with the
sample Qt code we found it was taking too much time. In fact, so MUCH time
that pulling an assignment from the past using GLUT, GLEW, and the rest of
their friends in the GNU/Linux realm was deemed quicker. Live and learn.

--------------------
 What does this do?
--------------------
We don't know yet, either... let us finish coding it first!

-----------------------
 Compiling and Running
-----------------------
This code is heavily based on the work of Dr. Ed Angel, and his provided
abstractions available at:

   www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/CODE/

Great care has been taken to allow this to be compiled by itself without too
much system specific setup and paths. 

The following dependencies exist:
  - libfreeglut
  - libglew
  - libGL
  - libXmu
  - libX11
  - libm

To compile on your system, a simple "make" will produce an executable named
"final" which you can run with "./final".
